Hello team,
    I am Satyam, second year Computer Science and Engineering student at National 
    Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India.
    I am determined to contribute to the MBDyn community and planning to 
    participate in GSOC-2021 by applying for MBDyn community.
    
    For my entry test I planned to use the relation between 
    - strain energy per unit length (Ul)
    - strain (E)
    - force  (F)
    to create this module. 
    
    the mathematical formulae used are 
    
    force (F) = ( 2 * Ul ) / strain (E)
    In order to prepare this module I took references from the 'module-constlaw', 
    'module-cont-contact' and 'module-hunt-crossley' present in the module directory.
    
    The module is available in gsoc-satyam-module directory.
